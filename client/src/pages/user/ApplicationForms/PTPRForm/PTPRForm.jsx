// PTPR - Private Tree Plantation Registration
// This Certificate shows the ownership of plantations or planted trees within private, titled lands or tax declared alienable and disposable lands.
// The issuance of PTPR requires inventory and ocular inspection in the area. Tree inventory for permits (e.g. TCP or PLTP) is a process conducted separately from the inspection for PTPR per existing DENR policies, rules and regulations.
